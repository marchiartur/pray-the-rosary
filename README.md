# Practical Guide: Pray the Rosary

## Goal
This project aims to create a 3D interface for chaplet prayer. The interface is designed to assist the user in following each prayer of the chaplet, making the experience more engaging and immersive. 

## Overview
The chaplet is a form of prayer that involves reciting a set of prayers in a specific order. The prayers are usually accompanied by the use of prayer beads or a chaplet, which helps the user keep track of which prayer they are on.

With this project, we aim to create a digital chaplet interface that uses 3D graphics to help the user visualize each prayer and keep track of their progress.

The interface will be designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users of all ages and backgrounds to use it easily. It will also be customizable, allowing users to choose from a range of different chaplets and prayers to suit their needs.
