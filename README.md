:warning:This is my official r3f-next starter. Had a [previous](https://github.com/aliiscript/next-r3f-starter) one but code was all over the place and wasnt happy with organization and have also learned alot more, will leave up tho for those who are using it :warning:

## Minimal react three fiber Starter using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with TypeScript and Styled Components

## How To Use

Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```
yarn create next-app [project name] -e https://github.com/aliiscript/next-three-fiber
# or
npx create-next-app [project name] -e https://github.com/aliiscript/next-three-fiber
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
